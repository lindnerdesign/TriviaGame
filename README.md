# TriviaGame

Create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. I chose the more difficult version of the game which required a timer on each trivia question. It also needed to be designed with valid HTML and CSS. I used donut related trivia to create a fun, light hearted game.
